        <p>The sound found me from when I was little, it was helping me to explain the Earths’ beauty – the one I could never describe my words. And I could never feel – I could only hear…
I do not simply record, mix, and edit sounds – I release the inner me, my imagination because only then I can let myself freely experiment with the magic of the sound, forgetting any limitations and boundaries.
Looking at my past, I could describe myself, firstly, as a talented child thirsty for the sound. When stepping my both feet into the rhythm – it all concluded to one big passion and capability, which led to the sound lover and enthusiast I consider myself today.</p>

        <p>Throughout the three years in University, I gained knowledge and experience in different production departments but I mostly found myself curious about sound engineering, especially the part of recording and making Foley and Sound Effects. I always come up with thousands of ideas of sound effects I want to make. Experimenting with different layers and combinations in DW’s like Ableton or Pro Tools I am able to give the sound diverse which can build up experience in various entertainments.</p>
